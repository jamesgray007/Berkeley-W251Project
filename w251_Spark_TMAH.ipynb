It would be more logical to imply that he's making a generalization, plus he himself is a Christian. As you stated in another comment, Western media doesn't portray Muslims or Arabs being killed, only Americans. Trump probably sees it the same way. So, ignorant? Maybe. A \"xenophobic prick\"? Not really.\n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.48346 So? What matters is how they got the money.\n\nDonald Trump has probably paid more in taxes than my father has ever earned, but Donald Trump simply got all the money from his dad and has only succeeded in bankrupting his brand....but he's still paid more taxes.\n-------------------------------------------------\nneutral None The issue is not what privileges animals may have but how privileged humans act.  The ultra rich need some act, such as killing and cutting off the tail of an elephant (what's that all about?), to feel like \"real men.\" For Trump hard to determine which son came from which wife.

Beyond that, american culture has only been around 200 years.\n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.334031 I'm going to have to patently disagree with you. No foreign nation will respect a bigoted asshole like Trump. Also, being in favor of universal health care doesn't mean he's a Democrat (Mitch McConnell, for instance, is a stout Republican who also favors universal health care because his demographic is largely in favor of it). These claims are absolute conjecture, and to say that Trump would be a better POTUS than Hillary is, quite frankly, horse shit. The guy obviously isn't in this for the long haul -- he's a self-promoter and egoist who is using the American political system to garner himself more influence. I don't think the man actually has any interest in being anything but the President of Trump Enterprises or whatever the fuck you call it.\n\nHe's insulting.

We get results like what we have because 70% of the fucking electorate was too goddam lazy to get off their asses and VOTE.\n\nVote for Sanders, Trump, Bush, Clinton, whatever you want -- but if you don't vote, I've got zero respect for you.\n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.441872 trump the bern?\n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.544872 \"Crony capitalism is a term describing an economy in which success in business depends on close relationships between business people and government officials.

You have to give them a path, and you have to make it possible for them to succeed. You have to do that.\u2019\n\nhttp://www.nationalreview.com/article/421045/donald-trump-fraud\n-------------------------------------------------\nNone None &gt;No foreign nation will respect a bigoted asshole like Trump.\n\nWhat makes you say he's bigoted? He only was discussing illegal immigrants. We have already taken 25% of Mexico's population.. at what point is it enough for you? Why not take more European immigrants as they are more likely to have money?\n\n&gt;Also, being in favor of universal health care doesn't mean he's a Democrat (Mitch McConnell, for instance, is a stout Republican who also favors universal health care because his demographic is largely in favor of it).\n\nMcConnell wasn't a registered Democrat for many years, Trump switch party affiliation about a decade ago. McConnell hasn't advocated for gay marriage or drug legalization. Trump said Bill Clinton was his favorite president in the modern era.\n\n&gt; These claims are absolute conjecture, and to say that Trump would be a better POTUS than Hillary is, quite frankly, horse shit.\n\nNo that's absolute truth. Hillary sucks.. would sell out the whole country for a couple million in donations to her Clinton charity racket, just like she sold off a huge portion of the US's uranium production to the Russians. The banks who want these sell-out trade deals are Hillary's main financial backers. \n\n&gt;The guy obviously isn't in this for the long haul -- he's a self-promoter and egoist who is using the American political system to garner himself more influence. I don't think the man actually has any interest in being anything but the President of Trump Enterprises or whatever the fuck you call it.\n\nNow that he's in it and he's leading the polls, I don't expect him to back out anytime soon. \n\n&gt;He's insulting. He's an insult to the Republican party, he's an insult to the political infrastructure, he's an insult to common sense and decency.\n\nHillary has no plan at all, she won't even open up to questions. Her politics are so mushy you don't know where she stands on anything except for open borders. She has no integrity, all her votes have already been bought and paid for by big business. Can you name **ONE** republican who made half as much as Hillary just by speaking to banks? She wasn't giving them investment advice and at $300,000 a speech you can be sure the only thing these banksters wanted were political favors. How does a couple who spent their entire lives in public service, like the Clintons, manage to accumulate $200million? Bernie or Trump 2016.. the only ones who won't sell the nation out.\n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.553417 I'm not pro trump \n-------------------------------------------------\nNone None Any data to back this up? \n\nI'd say if anything the media in the US is biased to the right under the auspices that both political parties are equally partisan and extreme so the assumption is that truth is in the middle between the two parties on everything. Which on most big issues is absurd.\n\n\n\n&gt;What I would argue is key to this situation \u2014 and, in particular, key to understanding how the conventional wisdom on Trump/McCain went so wrong \u2014 is the reality that a lot of people are, in effect, members of a delusional cult that is impervious to logic and evidence, and has lost touch with reality.\n\n&gt;I am, of course, talking about pundits who prize themselves for their centrism.\n\n&gt;Pundit centrism in modern America is a strange thing. It\u2019s not about policy, as you can see from the many occasions when members of the cult have demanded that Barack Obama change his ways and advocate things that \u2026 he was already advocating. What defines the cult is, instead, the insistence that the parties are symmetric, that they are equally extreme, and that the responsible, virtuous position is always somewhere in between.\n\n&gt;The trouble is that this isn\u2019t remotely true. Democrats constitute a normal political party, with some spread between its left and right wings, but in general espousing moderate positions. The GOP, on the other hand, is a deeply radical faction; even its supposed moderates are moderate only in tone, not in policy positions, and its base is motivated by anger against Others.\n\n&gt;What this means, in turn, is that to sustain their self-image centrists must misrepresent reality.\n\n&gt;On one side, they can\u2019t admit the moderation of the Democrats, which is why you had the spectacle of demands that Obama change course and support his own policies.\n\n&gt;On the other side, they have had to invent an imaginary GOP that bears little resemblance to the real thing. This means being continually surprised by the radicalism of the base. It also means a determination to see various Republicans as Serious, Honest Conservatives \u2014 SHCs? \u2014 whom the centrists know, just know, have to exist.\n\n&gt;We saw this a lot in the cult of Paul Ryan, who was and is very obviously a con man, whose numbers have never added up, but who was nonetheless treated with vast respect \u2014 and still sometimes is.\n\nhttp://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/27/the-donald-and-the-delusional/\n\n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.418355 Looks like everyone but Trump &amp; Bush are in a nosedive. \n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.221144 You know, I had one of those 'roaming' commuting thoughts and I realized after tapping that out, that man, he's as evil as the Koch brothers.  Then I realized the GOP party is really Koch or Trump.  Either way, they're just out to use the government for their own purposes.   And who knows, maybe Trump is doing this to try to keep the Koch hands off the Presidency seeing its like what, 1:15 for him to be the nominee? \n\n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.425359 That is the only thing that might...

This is just another hit piece by the leftist propaganda machine that is politifact, but they will fail to stop him and Trump WILL make our country great again!!\n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.228811 And that's 10s of millions of people.  Donald Trump will be the republican nominee or he will run 3rd party.  The only things that can derail his campaign at this point (maybe) are his monetary contributions to Clinton, being a registered democrat under Bush jr. and shitting on Reagan.  I can't imagine that anything he says will be a single nail in the coffin of his campaign.  \n-------------------------------------------------\nneutral None Donald Trump has paid more in taxes than Hillary Clinton has ever earned\n-------------------------------------------------\nNone None Wow, I never realized the striking resemblance...\n\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/CKlQ7OtUsAEhnqn.jpg\n\nhttp://esq.h-cdn.co/assets/15/31/980x490/landscape-1438023859-trump-as-biff.jpg\n\nCreepy.\n-------------------------------------------------\nNone None &gt; On the first half though, charity exists well outside the government.\n\nThe stats on child hunger and poverty proves that chairty alone is not enough to cope with these issues.\n\n&gt; The claim that anyone pro-life doesn't care about babies is on its face ludicrous.\n\nThey don't, Texas which is one of the most conservative and anti abortion states in the country is :\n\n44th in percentage of children in poverty (2010)\n\n50th in percentage of children insured (2009)\n\n42nd in per capita health care funding (2010)\n\n1st in amount of recognized carcinogens released into the air (2002) - something that affects children the most.\n\n&gt;But not moral and certainly a violation of human rights.\n\nAgain, one's perceived rights do not trump another person's actual rights.\n\n&gt;Well before abortion on demand was legal in this country. Here you could well have had a non viable fetus and spontaneous abortion and a donation that was not a violation of morality and human rights.\n\nAgain, rights above all belongs to the individual who has to go through the pain and commitment to bring up a child foremost, people who have ZERO obligations (like you) simply do not get to have the FIRST say.\n\n&gt;Individual human beings, a category that includes human beings in utero.\n\nInside other individual human beings who get the priority over unborn 'individuals'\n\n&gt;You can't kill other human beings is definitely a restriction of personal liberty. I'm ok with this.\n\nGreat, don't get an abortion then, nobody is forcing you to, be OK with whatever moral values you have, just don't try to impose it on others.\n\n&gt;Would you seriously rather have 350,000 dead kids? There are worse things than being on a list for adoption. I support adoption. I think it's too expensive as it is. I know people who have adopted within and outside of my own family. It's a noble calling.\n\nEveryone supports everything as long as they are on the dock for it, if the pro lifers were really pro life, first adopt all the children living miserably before advocating that more children suffer that they can't care less about. \n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.609459 Michigan would like to talk to you Trump\n-------------------------------------------------\nNone None So you are OK with liars as long as they are not politicians?\n\nThis is what he said about amnesty in 2012.\n\n&gt;\u201cTrump: \u2018You have to give them a path.

It gives a good background to his early years and how he created his \"Trump Empire\" and his business practices and ethics that are recent as to his Scotland Golf Course and Resort in Scotland that started in 2010. \n\nHe may not be for sale like the others that have big super PAC's, but his apparent greed, disregard for anyone in any class lower then the billionaire and millionaire class is infuriating, no disregard for the enviornment and the Scotland documentary - well, he's a real estate developer.

He only was discussing illegal immigrants.\n\nI'm going based on the words that the man has uttered. He wasn't \"only\" discussing illegal immigrants; he was casting a net upon all Hispanics living in the United States. You're creating him as a peaceful negotiator, when in reality he is a gad fly. \n\n&gt; Hillary sucks.. would sell out the whole country for a couple million in donations to her Clinton charity racket, just like she sold off a huge portion of the US's uranium production to the Russians.\n\nI'm not a Hillary supported, but this is directly regurgitated from Fox News. It's an attempt at conspiracy when there isn't one. Are her politics mushy? Yes, yes they are. There's no denying that. But these types of arguments are more of a distraction than reality.\n\n&gt; Now that he's in it and he's leading the polls, I don't expect him to back out anytime soon.\n\nHe's the first-choice candidate for about 20% of registered Republicans. That being said, he's also one of the most divisive. This is a good article about how phony these numbers are:\n\nhttp://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/donald-trump-is-the-nickelback-of-gop-candidates/\n\n&gt; Bernie or Trump 2016.. the only ones who won't sell the nation out.\n\nThese candidates do not operate outside of the realm of political influence. To believe so is dangerous.

But the cold hard truth is that the majority of the active voting base is old people or rural residents and don't see shit like this on their Facebook pages or other social media apps. All they care about is what he says. And they like what he says.\n\nBased on the level of excitement I hear from my family and other people I talk to, I'm willing to bet my bottom dollar that Trump becomes the Republican nominee, as much as the internet hates it. Doesn't matter.\n\nAnd if he has to go up against Hillary, he will demolish her. You know why? Because most American's are oblivious and will simply vote for him based on his celebrity. (See: Arnold Schwarzenegger. A Republican who overwhelmingly won a governor race in the most Democratic state in the Union.) \n\nHell, even if Sander's some how gets the nomination (incredibly unlikely), uninformed voters will look at the ballet on election day and see two names; Donald Trump (\"Oh I know that guy! He's a good business man and some of those people in Washington *need* to be fired!) OR Bernie Sanders (Who the fuck is Bernie Sanders?)\n\nSave this post. Mark my words. The internet will not be powerful enough to stop him. Because most of the people active in politics on the web are young, white liberal men. And their voices calling for reason will be drowned out by untrue, inflammatory remarks. Remarks he makes simply to stir up rural America.\n\nTLDR; Trump is going to be the next President.\n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.786157 So this is a pro Trump post?\n-------------------------------------------------\nNone None Hi `lolamp33`.

Counting all those making over 10 million, you'd *maybe* squeeze out a net wealth of 6 Trillion. But a 15% tax on 6 Trillion dollars =/= 5.7 unless Trump knows something we don't.~~\n\nMASSIVE EDIT: Went back and didn't like the numbers I was using, so I went to the [2014 Global Wealth Databook](https://publications.credit-suisse.com/tasks/render/file/?fileID=5521F296-D460-2B88-081889DB12817E02). Credit Suisse sets the net wealth of the world at roughly 263 Trillion dollars. Assuming a conservative estimate of *world* millionaires owning 50% of the wealth in the world, that gives us 131.5 Trillion dollars in wealth. Total wealth in the United States was projected to be at 84 Trillion dollars. Now, limiting ourselves to American millionaires (top 10% of earners), we see something [around 75% of wealth ownership](http://www.mybudget360.com/wealth-inequality-america-top-10-percent-of-us-households-control-75-percent-of-wealth/). So the top ten percentile have a *wealth* evaluation of somewhere around 63 Trillion dollars with a couple asterisks attached. So, subtract the wealth of those who own between 1 - 10 million and can represent that in liquid assets (which I have no idea where to go to calculate) and you'll get the taxable wealth that Trump wants to tap into. Maybe that equals 40 Trillion, maybe it doesn't.\n\nConsider also: If that wealth reflects stock options, what would happen if the richest people in the country had to offload literally *trillions* of dollars in stock over the course of a single day/pay period.\n\nI'd love to be proven wrong, but this ~~just looks like bunk~~ smells curious to me. ~~Unless Trump plans to tax the world, in which case... lol, good luck.~~ Seems slightly more plausible now, but I'd love to hear an actual plan to implement this that accounts for the long-term lost revenue from inheritance taxes and what guarantee, if any, Trump can give that such a measure would never be enacted again that would provide incentive for the wealthy to actually willingly part with such a large chunk of their wealth holdings.\n\nMASSIVE EDIT: Kudos to /u/Bipedal_Horse for encouraging me to double-check my crappy numbers.\n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.34709 Seriously?

I'm sure someone else agrees.     Trump,  the man, is a lot different than the platform he's running on.    I personally think he's just being subversive to get the vote of people who don't understand what actually needs to be done.    I actually find him very similar to Clinton.

It isn't as though we haven't seen how this plays out already and the current economic situation we've found ourselves in isn't going to last forever. As ridiculous as the poor may seem, something is going to have to give sooner or later and when that happens either we'll have been completely bled dry by the rich (thereby causing another complete economic collapse) or the system will be forced to change as a direct result of massive, widespread poverty among the lower classes.\n\n\n\n&gt; hes interested in making america STRONG\n\n\nClearly, because a guy who has no idea what's going on in the country and lies every opportunity he gets (to an impressive degree, even among conservatives) is obviously someone that knows fuck all (much less cares) about the United States being 'strong.' Frankly, if improving the strength of the country was actually a concern (it isn't), it would still be ridiculous to give Trump any credibility to lead that charge. Personally, I would look to someone that actually fucking knows something about the country and our military, like John McCain.

However, [your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/3fh553/trump_proposes_massive_onetime_tax_on_the_rich/) has been removed for the following reason(s):\n\n* edition.cnn.com is a banned domain.\n\nIf you have any questions about this removal, please feel free to [message the moderators.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/politics&amp;subject=Question regarding the removal of this submission by /u/jeffmcneill&amp;message=I have a question regarding the removal of this [submission.](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/3fh553/trump_proposes_massive_onetime_tax_on_the_rich/\\))\n-------------------------------------------------\nneutral None politifact also has a habit of not being a neutral fact checker as they claim to be, and this needs to be taken into account. (for example when trump said \"government numbers on the number of illegal immigrants are wrong\" and threw out a number of his own, politifact rated him false \"because his numbers didn't match the government's census data\".)\n\nthat isn't an isolated occurrence either. politifact absolutely has a bias that is prominent in a lot of their reviews. as such, this needs to be kept in mind.\n\nthe information politifact did give us raises eyebrows (the percentage of christian refugees is significantly smaller than the percentage of christants in the syrian population, and the percentage of muslim refugees is noticeably larger than the percentage of the population that is muslim). this alone doesn't mean that politifact is wrong, but it certainly raises questions.\n\nto really know who's wrong, we need to know not only how many people actually are coming in as refugees, but how many applied to begin with. if the applicant pool matches the general population's makeup a little bit closer and it turns out that far more christans are actually being denied refugee status than muslims, that would lend a lot of credibility to trump's claim.\n\nyou also have to be careful taking the government at their word about if a policy does/doesn't exist. don't forget that all the surveillance programs that snowden revealed \"didn't exist\", but actually did. just because the government says that a policy doesn't exist doesn't necessary mean that statement is accurate.\n-------------------------------------------------\nNone None \n\n&gt; But republicans now say you can take all the rich money and still not pay off debt... Hmmm....\n\nTrump said that before he decided trolling the Republicans was more fun\n-------------------------------------------------\nneutral None The problem with this is that at the time, the US was operating at a budget surplus and was actually projected to pay off the debt in something like 25-30 years (by the most optimistic projections)...  Then Bush Jr happened. Massive tax cuts undid all of the progress that had been made and the giant war expenditures that followed put us in a WAY deeper hole. \n\nJust imagine if we'd used that surplus money to start meaningful social programs like single payer health care, progressive energy/environmental policies etc.  \n\nWhat Trump proposed here was nothing short of redistribution of wealth. It's awesome, but it would never ever happen.                                                   \n-------------------------------------------------\nneutral None Hyperbole is not something to be encouraged. It distorts facts and gets people riled up to the point of making stupid decisions. We should want leaders who make decisions based on accurate information and careful consideration. \n\nThe problem with Trump is that he has built his persona around hyperbole. Every time he says something exaggerated, he doubles down. He has the opportunity to clarify or present evidence, but he usually just sticks to slogans because he knows the base eats it up. It gives him a tough guy air that his supporters love, but the fact remains that he plays loose with the truth. You have to ask yourself if you want someone like that in office (yes, all politicians lie, but his lies are potent BS). \n\nAnd politifact did address your concern. They point out that Syria is only 10% Christian. Proportionally-speaking, you would expect fewer Christians unless this was a war on Christians only. Are Christians targeted by ISIS? Yes, but so are other Muslims. Why would we expect a disproportionate number of Christian refugees?\n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.578466 not only less-educated Americans, but stupid Americans. Half of our population has a sub-100 IQ, and I guarantee you that no one with a higher IQ supports Trump.\n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.620928 With this source and a few other articles he wrote in 1999, I honestly believe Donald Trump is working for the Democrats to destroy the Republican parties credibility. \n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.257995 He's playing the long con. Trump for President!\n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.382077 But it would be easier and clearer to just say \"many can't come\" (which still implies, however, a purposeful policy of discrimination, which isn't based in evidence). That's why you'll often hear politicians say \"it's hard to get a job\" rather than \"it is impossible\". Yes, the latter is more emotionally stirring, but the former simply leaves more room for accuracy. Trump was the one who chose to make the bold, yet inaccurate statement.\n\nYou seem to take issue with our nitpicking his word choice, but if no one challenged him, he'd keep repeating it over and over, which misinforms the public. What is so wrong about stating issues with more nuance? If he really thinks that our refugee policies are wrong, he should paint a detailed argument about that based on the available evidence. Hyperbole suggests he doesn't have a high opinion of the voter's intelligence. \n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.815148 Lots of pro trump posts on here up voted and commented by people with like 1 day on reddit.\n\nJust thought people should know.\n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.533384 Wow. I can't believe reddit just made me want to vote for Donald Trump.\n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.415338 Look everyone! Trump did something legal! Let's pretend it's not and fling poo at him!\n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.828321 I don't think it's terrifying to democrats. It's pure comedy and the only thing that makes sense is Trump is a secret democrat trying to show the true face of the Republican party.\n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.367712 My God Trump has embraced Palin. Duh?\n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.649069 I worked at a JW Marriott hotel some years ago as a concierge, for about a year and a half before I decided the hotel industry wasn't for me and went to college...\n\nAt peak seasons we would bring in 500+ Filipino workers to help out, give them room and board and everything for like 3-4 months stretch.  This is 1 resort hotel with about 540 rooms.  Let me just say that the fact he has ONLY gotten 1100 visas for people over the years is frankly kind of amazing as my single hotel would have broken that in 2 years running, and Trump owns a lot of hotels.\n\nHonestly, this makes me think even more he doesn't actually try to look elsewhere for the jobs.\n\nOh and for the people that want to give the hotel a hard time for doing this, let me just say that they advertise these jobs all the time, willing to travel and be essentially the manual labor at peak seasons, but most Americans don't want a 3 month stint job that's gone the next 9 months.  Seriously, months before the season hits the hotel would advertise job openings in housekeeping and other maintenance stuff and they would never ever be filled or even be closed to filled by peak season, so they import the workers.\n\nOff season occupancy can be down to 10% of rooms full, and the hotel is essentially bleeding money til the on-seasons pickup.  You can't keep workers on in those numbers year round, but if you want to maintain your 4 or 5 star hotel ratings, when it's peak season you need a TON of workers to keep things going smoothly and that every guest feels attended to.  Believe me, they would HAPPILY prefer a local person to take the job, because they don't have to pay for their apartment, their airfare, their extra living expenses and their VISA fees.\n\nSo, frankly, I am pretty freakin impressed the number is so low for Trump's hotels.  Makes me realize this is just a smear piece for the ill-informed. \n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.352604 The more I think and read about Trump's campaign, the more I think he is trolling everyone. Seriously, can he really be as stupid as he is making himself look?\n-------------------------------------------------\nneutral None Your syntax is almost up to Palin's level. Trump has embraced and tapped her for a big job eh don't ya know. You betcha. You can't even understand her when the Teleprompter works. \n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.37092 He's also anti immigration, just like Trump.\n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.257079 The thing is he is also NOT pandering to the Christian right either, which is frankly kind of amazing and makes you realize he is going to say what he thinks.  I mean, that Family summit thing he went to and they asked him, \"Do you ask God for forgiveness?\"  I mean, it was kind of a cringey question to begin with, but all the other Republicans that went to that summit gave the canned, typical and expected response, \"I try to always rely on God, and we are all imperfect and we make mistakes so I always ask God to forgive me.\"  And then Trump is like, \"Eh, I try to live my life so I don't have to ask for forgiveness.\" lol  He is like \"I make mistakes and I learn from em,\" roughly speaking.  \n\nIt was frankly kind of refreshing to see this, as the Republican party and conservative movement has largely been commandeered by the Christian right anti-gay crowd and such, when in reality, a LOT of Americans like the idea of a smaller gov't and a balanced budget, and are anti-corporatism, want a single-payer healthcare option, but yet could care less who you marry, and what you do with your life.  Trump is kind of like that voice, imo, and him being the anti-politician does it.\n\nAll I see here on /r/politics though is how he is pandering to the least of these people and xenophobes and such.  I think that's totally an incorrect assessment, probably largely because people are getting slanted news from this subreddit, which leads only to their confirmation bias on the guy.\n\nI, like most, was pretty skeptical of him, but after listening to him on things like \"Meet the press\" and his CNN interviews and so on, he's growing on me.  As someone who really likes Bernie but cannot stand Hillary, if the election was tomorrow and Bernie was the Dem frontrunner and Trump the Repub, I'd vote for Bernie, but wow, if Hillary was there instead of Bernie, I would 100% go for Trump.  She just seems so dishonest, so much more of the same old same old we've allowed ourselves to keep voting into Washington.\n-------------------------------------------------\nneutral None I dunno if Bernie can actually beat trump. There would actually be some media coverage of the things he's said/done.\n\n* Thinks immigration and open borders are a right wing conspiracy\n* Wrote a letter to the editor in the 1970s saying women like to be gang raped.\n* Used to be in favor of nationalizing industries\n\nYou could run quite the smear campaign against him.\n\nEdit: Lol, don't downvote me after you were smug. That's foul play. \n-------------------------------------------------\nneutral None Well, that is the important piece of information. In fact, that would be the best evidence to support Trump's insinuation that the gov is turning them away. Why didn't he present that evidence? The burden of proof is on him, not politifact. Their job is to assess the validity of his claims, not necessarily to prove that the opposite is true. His claim was that no Christian Syrian refugees were admitted. That is false. \n\nI see that your are saying that \"unproven\" might be better than \"false\" since evidence about rejections is missing. But if someone is going to make unproven claims and assert them as truth before they have evidence, that's as good as false. \n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.459132 According to whom? Trump?\n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.811836 Trump is very entertaining for everyone and there's no rush to choose a real candidate.

You can thank the Commission on Presidential Debates for that.\n-------------------------------------------------\nNone None Didn't he actually say something more like, \"It's the best-selling business book of all time.  Or, it's one of the top selling business books of all time.\" Then he laughs and said something like, \"I don't know, I am sure some news people are going to come out and if it's not they are all gonna claim I lied, that's why I say it's one of the top, but it might be the top.\"\n\nIf you look at straight business books, his might very-well be the top, as his book is pure business, how to make business deals with people, whilst some could argue that the \"How to win friends &amp; influence people\" or \"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People\" or the others are more like \"attitude\" books, positive thinking self-help books about confidence and listening to others and so on, whilst his \"Art of the Deal\" is strictly about the business world.\n\nThis is the problem with this politifact thing imo, is the actual publishing world's \"business\" category is not well-defined, and if you go into Barnes and Noble, you might find they classify things differently that other bookstores might.\n\nAnyway, even if it is false, the few interviews I've watched of him on youtube he seems to state it's one of the best, not THE best, and anytime he said, \"the best,\" he corrects himself and says one of the best.\n\nKind of seems like cherrypicking a sound-bit for an anti-trump bit.\n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.301811 Comparatively, he's definetly a conservative but his redeeming factor is that he's openly supportive of compromising with democrats to create a working government. He's supported a more moderate Republican Party on domestic issues and a strong Neo-con foreign policy. Compared to someone like Trump, Cruz, and Santorum among others in the race he is a fairly moderate candidate in the race. \n-------------------------------------------------\nNone None As painful as it is for me to say... if anyone can get hit that mystical 15% poll requirement (i.e. the non-major party candidate general election debate requirement), it might be Trump.\n\nWhether or not he can keep this train going into the general election season remains to be seen though.\n-------------------------------------------------\nNone None &gt;It's 100% just Trump trying to get ~~that PAC~~ money.\n\nThe guy has a product, and his product is himself. It's why he puts his name on buildings.\n\nHe's selling books and attracting attention to his TV show. He doesn't want to be president, he'll probably make way less money as president.  He's just trying to make \"Trump\" a household name for as long as he can.\n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.399965 Trump's \"Political Machine\" is being built with a lot of faulty parts.  He already hired one of Sarah Palin's aides to be his Political Director.  If you listen to any of his spokespeople on TV, it's clear that they are all *\"Yes Men\"* who only tell Trump what he wants to hear.

He would lose against pretty much anyone.\n-------------------------------------------------\nNone None To be fair, it does seem like its been very heavily pro-Sanders on Reddit, I'll say its due to genuine inspired support, but I welcome other viewpoints making their cases. It can only be constructive.\n\nI always seem to hear the two together recently, but thats understandable. I read your explanation and half it was to avoid a republican presidency which I agree is really undesirable. The other was because she is \"the right candidate at the right time\". That's vague, could you clarify? The reason I think Bernie is just slightly better. \n\nFor starters, he's polling [well](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-07-30/poll-donald-trump-leads-gop-primary-rivals-but-trails-hillary-clinton-and-bernie-sanders) against the Republican field. Not only that, he has shown himself able to capture swaths of Republican votes. He did so numerous times during his career and looks to be doing so [again](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/06/23/1395700/-Republicans-for-Bernie-Sanders#)\n\nBut also for reasons I've articulated before:\n\"Clinton's position on Glass stegal, on the TPP, and in general her campaign finances are troublesome.  Very critical issues because they represent all different aspects of the same problem with her. She's a corporatist.\"\n\nShe's [not](http://thehill.com/policy/finance/249050-clinton-dodges-on-glass-steagall\n) for the Glass-Stegall act. \nShe hasn't shown herself to be against the TPP, as a matter of fact she may have fudged her own involvement before a meeting of Union Leaders, but in reality her top aides were involved \"[deeply](http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/30/politics/hillary-clinton-keystone-pipeline-trans-pacific-partnership/)\" in the TPP [talks](http://www.ibtimes.com/cables-show-hillary-clintons-state-department-deeply-involved-trans-pacific-2032948)\n\nAgain to her [credit](http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/05/19/today-in-politics-clinton-says-citizens-united-would-guide-her-supreme-court-picks). She did defy expectations and announce campaign finance reform would guide her supreme court picks. She has paid lip service to the idea at the very least.\n\nHer four campaign pillars can be summarized as: Economy, strengthening communities and families, fix political system, protect nation.

You can read it below.*\n\n----\n\nThere are several problems I have with this.\n\n- It shows that immigrants use welfare benefits at higher rates than natives. Most of them are using food stamps. Per person not much is spent. Medicaid is provided to the elderly and young which I'm ok with. $500 Billion dollars are spent on all 8 welfare services, 50 billion of that is spent on food welfare. Since hispanics are around 20% of the population probably about 100Billion of that is spent on hispanics. In the grand scheme of things that is NOTHING. Think about all the damages a handful of corporations and lobbyists have done to this country in the past 10 years and that will dwarf any burden our immigrant population MIGHT put have put on it over 60 years.

If Trump wins the GOP nomination that effectively takes them out of the contention for the presidency.\n-------------------------------------------------\nNone None &gt;Trump is a bigoted far right-winger who is the literal anti-thesis of a Democrat.\n\nRead the rest of my responses. He specifically said illegal immigrants.. He said illegal immigrant criminals, rapists, murderers and drug-dealers that we have deported are being pushed back into the US by the Mexican government. He said the Mexican government doesn't want to put up with these criminals so they dump them on the US to let our stupid leaders deal with their problems. He said nothing about legal immigrants. We have already taken 25% of Mexico's population.. at what point is it enough for you? Why not take more European immigrants as they are more likely to have money?\n\n&gt;You cannot support Bernie Sanders and then say you'd vote for Trump unless you have no concept of politics and just associate with names.\n\nNot true. Like you, I believe healthcare is a right for all US citizens. Unlike you and Hillary, I actually care about making sure the welfare system is sustainable for the foreseeable future. I lived in LA a few years ago.. the state of California has been completely taken over by illegals.. Hispanics are now the majority and 30% of the population are on Medicaid. Hospitals along the boarder towns all the way to Texas have been shut down due to bankruptcy from illegal immigrants using service and not paying. The welfare system will collapse if you allow endless immigration from the 3rd world.   \n\n&gt;Even centrist Hillary is significantly closer to Bernie than **Hillary**- you mean Trump\n\nHillary is neck deep in these trade deals. Sorry but corruption matters to me. \n\n&gt;It's also worth noting that if a Republican wins 2016 that means the Supreme Court gets right-wing nominations and shifts to an even stronger right-wing majority for the next few decades. Do you know what that means? It means the progressive reform that Bernie is vying for will be impossible. Completely impossible. There is ZERO chance of Citizens United being overturned, single payer, or getting money out of politics with a Republican Supreme Court.\n\nThe constitutional amendment to end Citizens United is never going to happen under any president. If you want money out of politics, end deductions on political donations above $1,000. Trump supports universal healthcare (which does not necessarily have to be single payer- even most countries in Europe where I come from are not just a single-payer system, and just like in the US illegal immigrants are draining the welfare systems in Europe). Hillary has expressed very hawkish opinions on war and she is controlled by the Saudis.  \n\n&gt; The Supreme Court needs a left-wing majority for these things Bernie is talking about to be possible.\n\nThat's why I support Bernie, but Hillary is totally untrustworthy and would be a terrible leader.. I just plain don't like her. I won't vote to sell the country down the drain just to vote for someone with a D next to their name when the other guy who is running R is basically like a Democrat anyway.  \n\n&gt;So I find it suspicious you'd say that you're a Bernie Sanders supporter, and then would talk about potentially ruining everything he wants. You're likely a right-wing troll.\n\n&gt;Edit: Yup you are.\n\nNope. What have I advocated for that could be considered right-wing- ending subsidies for corporations?

Doesn't make my responses definitive from a \"This is why it is good\" perspective, merely more \"This is some of the whys and wherefores.\" \n\nLet's say we had one person one vote and a person who advocated \"The government will give every person $100,000. \n\nNow, most of us would look at that, think \"Nice, but not realistic,\" and vote for somebody else.\n\nBut what if there are many somebody else one issue candidates - including the person running on the platforms:\n\n\"The government will outlaw abortion.\"\n\"The government will shut down the IRS.\"\n\"The government will close its borders.\"\n\"The government will bomb the entire Middle East off the face of the world.\"\n\"The government will pay for me to have a new and better hair style\" &lt;-- Trump\n\nAnd let's even include a couple of traditional party candidates plus the smatterings of other popular parties, Libertarian, Green....\n\nIs any of those candidates going to obtain a majority of votes?\n\nWhich of those candidates is going to obtain a plurality of votes?\n\nWill the people who know that we don't want a single issue candidate in office prevail, or will candidate one get enough votes to bankrupt the United States?\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nneutral None I agree. Trump was polling at 1% in June, just two months ago. A lot has changed since then. Using dated polls is meaningless. \n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.353223 I agree with your assessment, but that only means we need to investigate and make sure we're not discriminating, whether intentional or unintentional. For example, they could be applying to other closer countries as you said because they're poor. I also don't know how the economic status of Christians there so it could be the complete opposite of that.\n\nThe point is that what Trump said isn't an outright lie. He's bringing attention to the issue so now hopefully it'll be looked at better. Everyone's focusing more on the \"Trump lied again\" circlejerk because he said \"you can't\" instead of \"it's possibly 3x harder\" so they're not paying attention to what he actually said.\n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.0892081 Not one of the major candidates (Trump excluded) have core conservative values in my opinion, therefore I would consider them RINO's. In re: to Trump, beyond his stance on immigration, which that single issue appeals to moderates and even the left, I'm not very familiar with his other positions.\n\nBut in re: to the RINOs, Perry, Rubio and Christie seem to hold the most conservative values from before the party was hacked by the religious right.\n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.635491 My guess is that given that Trump can't interrupt others every 10 seconds and shout/insult them to oblivion like he does most of the reporters in his interviews, the debates will actually be focused upon reasonable argumentation, in which case Trump runs the risk of being literally laughed out of the building...not good considering that this is not a comedy show.\n\nBest case scenario is probably that Trump finds a way to offend so much that he gets banned from the debates and he runs as a 3rd party candidate.\n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.281942 Trump: Hired help should be short, brown, docile and easily dismissed.\n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.509467 Lot of people half protecting trump....

But why waste any opportunity to use people who are in the US for jobs that could be done by them? I mean, Trump claims he'll be the best jobs president, but based on his record in business should we expect him to say, bring in 100,000 people from other countries for every 1 mil jobs he creates, or whatever equivalent number per percent of jobs that immigrants made up in his personal companies. That could be jobs people in the US could be filling, no matter if the number is 10,000, 50,000, or whatever.\n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.24548 While the former leaves more room for accuracy, it's also a very politically correct way and very well-assessed statement. Trump doesn't do that.\n\nYou guys are treating him like every other politician when he's not in the way he gives speeches and makes his statements. I've never been a fan of twisting politician's words and that's increasingly easy with Trump. For example, when he made his original speech, everyone focused on the portion where he apparently said all mexicans \"are rapists.\" In reality he said something closer to (I'm not directly quoting him, but it's a more accurate statement than the latter) \"Illegal immigrants... cause issues, which include drug traffickers and rapists with some that are good people.\" Once again, we need to first establish that he's speaking about ILLEGAL immigrants. Then we need to at least leave the whole sentence intact instead of saying he called all Mexican immigrants rapists. Then we need to focus on what he meant, which is that a lot of these people could easily and easily are criminals. When we don't secure a border, we do let some innocent good families come through easier than immigrating legally. However, that also means that drug traffickers, sex traffickers, and all the crime (this is a fact, these crimes all have higher rates in Mexico and Mexico is corrupt) can easily come through as well.\n\nBut just remember that challenging him on Reddit, especially r/politics, only means you're only joining the Bernie Sanders is God and Trump is Hitler circlejerk. It's very clear that Reddit does not like Trump and the only things that make it to the front page are negatively biased editorials. If Sanders made a similar speech people would be upvoting \"Sanders calls an investigation into possible immigration discrimination\" and people would be defending him and saying \"obviously he didn't literally mean none of them can get in but it's a problem\" because \"Bernie wouldn't just lie like that.\"\n\nFor example right now we have \"Bernie Sanders Will Consider Legalizing Marijuana If Elected President\" on the top of /r/politics which is an article with NO CITATIONS OR QUOTES FROM SANDERS. It links another article, which also only states that he would \"look\" at legalizing it. When we actually pull up the transcripts, he gives a weak response on basically only \"looking\" at it and not being able to do it without Congress. So he states that he can't actually do anything about it because it's not up to him. Then he states that he's concerned with people ending up in jail. This sounds exactly like Obama but Reddit turned it into \"Bernie Sanders Will Consider Legalizing Marijuana If Elected President\" like he has the power to do so by paraphrasing an article that paraphrased the actual interview.\n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.400754 There is hypocrisy all around on this.  One one side, the proponents of illegal immigration (or open borders) like to say that illegal immigrants only take the jobs that Americans won't do, they pay taxes, they create other jobs by working and spending money in the community, and their overall net value is positive.  Yet somehow, if Trump uses the guest worker program to legally bring people into the country to do those same jobs that Americans won't do he is taking jobs away from Americans.  I don't get it.  Given the two choices, I prefer that the people are brought in legally.  Trump wins.\n\nOn the right, people say that the illegals are taking the jobs that Americans won't do *for the same price that the illegals are doing those jobs.*  If the illegals were deported and the border secured, the wages for those jobs would increase and Americans would apply for the jobs.  The marketplace would correct itself.  By that argument, it is reasonable to expect Trump to increase wages and give the jobs to America.  The left wins.\n\nThe truth lies somewhere in the middle, of course.  The guest worker program is administered through the department of labor and the host company has the burden to show that they cannot hire US citizens to fill the jobs at a reasonable, going wage.  It isn't unreasonable to legally import workers for these types of service industry jobs.  I prefer a business do exactly that over hiring illegals.  Net, net: Trump wins.\n\ntl;dr: There is nothing to see here but a shit show over legal, fair business practices.  Trump himself isn't the hypocrite in this one, but there is plenty of hypocrisy to go around.\n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.289696 Trump hasn't been vocally outspoken against LEGAL immigration, has he?\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nNone None &gt; Trump may be tough on the Iran deal, \n\nTrump knows nothing about the Iran deal.  He's never read it and he's not a very bright man, so I suspect he wouldn't have understood its intricacies even if he had.  \n\nHe's a dog who's only barking because he wants attention.\n\n&gt;He's never filed for personal bankruptcy.\n\nHe's got a 300+ million trust fund from Daddy backing him and his gambling ventures up.  He will NEVER need to file for personal bankruptcy.  The only thing we can measure him on are his own business deals and that's a mess in anyone's book.\n\n&gt;You only encourage more illegal immigrants to come if you give them amnesty.\n\nSo?  I already pointed out that immigration into the US of all kinds is a GOOD thing for the US, especially our baby boomer elderly, who need Social Security funded by an increasing tax paying labor force.\n\n&gt;Bottom line is they are a tremendous burden on the system\n\nCompared to what?  Every other country in the world can afford to deal with this.  So can we.  We're the richest nation in the world.  Why do we think a few million people is a significant \"burden\" on systems designed to handle 300+ million people?  It doesn't.  \n\nWhat they are is a \"burden\" on the PROFITS of a handful of hospital megacorps.  \n\n&gt;You can't have open borders and a welfare state. \n\nA) we don't have open borders.  Net immigration is ZERO right now from Mexico, etc.  This is a non-issue being used to make YOU afraid because that's how reprehensible scumbags keep themselves in power.\n\nB)  The entire world is moving to a \"welfare state\".  Machines are coming to replace upwards of 75% of every human job in the next 25 years.  Starting with the truckers and cab drivers, who will be replaced by driverless cars, etc.  \n\nYou are arguing the Cold War economics of fear long after that age and that economic model died.\n\nAnd if you think things are crazy today, wait until you see what the world looks like in 25 years when only the brightest and best of us can do things machines can't do...\n\nDo you want to see mass starvation across the world and the anarchy that will entail here at home and elsewhere?  Or would you rather see every human being get enough food, shelter, clothing, and healthcare that they can make the most of their own lives...with or without a labor job that society no longer needs them to do?\n\nThe \"welfare state\" will be expanding to include almost everyone...and there's not a damn thing you can do to stop it...because it's the 1% who control the means and methods of production.  And they're going all in on the machines....today.\n\nhttp://www.techrepublic.com/article/chinese-factory-replaces-90-of-humans-with-robots-production-soars/\n\nThis is what you should be paying attention to...not the fate of a handful of Mexican fruit pickers (who will lose their jobs to machines too, btw).\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.600884 There is also the issue with your ability to attract and retain talented young workers. They don't want to live in places with shitty schools, broken infrastructure, shitty transit systems, no medicaid expansion, etc. and a small tax cut which mostly goes to their boss isn't going to trump that. \n-------------------------------------------------\nneutral None To Donald Trump. If she didn't appeal to him, than why contribute so much to her campaigns.\n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.536099 Now that is an interesting point. Republicans using abortion as an instrument to drum up angst with no intention of doing anything major to change it. It reminds me of their immigration platform. Guys like Donald Trump will rail against illegal immigrants, but behind closed doors they are benefiting enormously from the low wage, high obedience workforce. So much so that they also won't do anything major to change illegal immigration. \n\nAnd that leaves the democrats to do something about illegal immigration....Fuck it. Too complicated. Beer me up Scotty. \n-------------------------------------------------\nNone None @realDonaldTrump I wish good luck to all of the Republican candidates that traveled to California to beg for money etc. from the Koch Brothers.

He will NEVER need to file for personal bankruptcy. The only thing we can measure him on are his own business deals and that's a mess in anyone's book.\n\nHe inherited $40million and turned it into net worth over $4billion, doesn't sound so dumb to me.\n\n&gt;Compared to what? Every other country in the world can afford to deal with this. So can we. We're the richest nation in the world. Why do we think a few million people is a significant \"burden\" on systems designed to handle 300+ million people? It doesn't. \n\nNo, every other 1rst world country is being strained by the burden of illegal immigrants on the welfare system. I immigrated here from Britain so you can't tell me this is not so. Nearly all of Europe has felt the tremendous burden that illegal immigrants have placed on their welfare system. You know what the most popular name in London is now?.. Muhammad... that's why I got the hell out of there, the writing was on the wall (BTW it's very difficult to get a US visa from Europe because the US is taking so much legal immigration from Mexico instead). The US is the most indebted nation in the world.\n\n&gt;What they are is a \"burden\" on the PROFITS of a handful of hospital megacorps.\n\nI lived in LA a few years ago.. the state of California has been completely taken over by illegals.. Hispanics are now the majority and 30% of the population are on Medicaid. Hospitals along the boarder towns all the way to Texas have been shut down due to bankruptcy from illegal immigrants using service and not paying. The welfare system will collapse if you allow endless immigration from the 3rd world. \n\n&gt;A) we don't have open borders. Net immigration is ZERO right now from Mexico, etc. This is a non-issue being used to make YOU afraid because that's how reprehensible scumbags keep themselves in power.\n\nNo it isn't net zero. You have no way of knowing this because we can't track all the people who sneak in. How did Hispanics become the majority in California so quickly? 30% of felony convicted federal prisoners are illegal immigrants. Zero is what illegal immigrants contribute to the economy after subtracting expenses from education and healthcare that they don't pay into.. their kids born here are often on welfare that my tax dollars pay for. I do not want to see the US become Mexico.\n\n&gt;Or would you rather see every human being get enough food, shelter, clothing, and healthcare that they can make the most of their own lives...with or without a labor job that society no longer needs them to do?\n\nI'd rather they stay in their home countries and deal with their own problems while we deal with ours.   \n\n&gt;The \"welfare state\" will be expanding to include almost everyone...and there's not a damn thing you can do to stop it\n\nI don't want to stop it, I just don't want tax dollars paying for people who don't belong here. \n\n&gt;because it's the 1% who control the means and methods of production. And they're going all in on the machines....today.\n\nThere are many things we can do to foster job creation in the US until that time comes. \n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.765384 Trump lies about being bald with his haircut. He has told you a lie before he even opens his mouth. Is anyone, even his supporters, actually expecting him to be truthful on important stuff like this? \n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.4499 I thought Bernie has experienced a surge. There was a poll that showed Bernie would beat Trump in the general election if it was held now. The question is will Trump keep surging or has he topped out or will people get tired and decide he is not very Presidential. \n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.490096 Let me be clear to start.\n\nI Don't like Trump. At all.\n\nI believe he's a self aggrandizing pompous ass, with no concern other than Donald Trump. He would be the only person in the history of *ever* to be a worse president than 'Dubbya'.\n\nBut seriously? This bitch fest article? Seriously?\n\nThe man owns companies that employ in excess of 22,000 people. Do you really, for one second believe that this man, while on the campaign trail, personally oversees the hiring and firing of each employee? The actual day-to-day machinery of the companies he owns? The man probably has no idea what is happening at the level of hiring seventy, 7....0.... fucking people. He deals in things like 100 million dollar deals, not the hiring of individual wait staff. I'd bet money the guy doesn't even have a clue what his company's hiring practices are. And it's not his fault. His pay level is like 3-4 levels above the guy who decides what the hiring practices would be for that specific location. It's so far beyond anything the man could possibly deal with that it's truly absurd to suggest that the man is being hypocritical with regards to his 'hire american' statements.\n\nI mean, if you're going to flay a person for supposed hypocrisies, pick a topic that the man has some direct control over.\n\n\nDon't get me wrong. He's still a douche lord, but this argument is invalid at best.\n\n\n\n\nEdit:\n\nFirst; Canadian. Don't need the history lesson on American Presidents, but if Andrew Jackson was duelling people all the time, he must have been pretty good. Eventually odds are you'll lose. The beating people with a cane thing is a little excessive, but I bet he didn't invade 2 different countries and cause like 10,000,000 attributed deaths, so remember, personal quirks are a nuisance and may be \"bad\", but professional incompetence can kill, and that's horrendous.\n\nSecondly, I've owned several businesses over the years, they've done well, but as a member of the military they don't typically last long (one posting to the next, so 2-4 years) so to all the people posting in my inbox about \"it's your name on the business, its your responsibility\" I understand fully. I also understand, unlike man of you, that small business owners are *vastly* different from multi-billion dollar conglomerates with employees totalling (did more research here) some 30,000 people. Yes it's his name on the door, yes it's his business, but the people he hires are fucking human. Much like you. And they can, and will, do things they think are best. Even if those things they do, the owner may not agree with. Fuck it happens at the level of small business owner. Your employees think they're doing something\"smart\" or \"good\" or \"easy\" or \"cheap\" and viola! It's not what you want and your name is on it. Ultimately you suffer the consequences, but the responsibility is ALWAYS shared between the guy on top *and the guy who actually made the decision to do these things*. That's why as a business owner you can fire the guy who doesn't do what you want.\n\nThe only thing left to see is whether he changes or sets a company wide policy (which may not in fact actually exist). But he is Donald Trump and he is a *bit* of a pin head... so I'm not going to hold my breath.\n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.278328 To be fair, Trump is really good at making other investors in his properties lose money, while he takes little financial hit.\n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.0487221 Trump argues Mexicans are taking jobs from Americans. Meanwhile, Trump actually goes out of his way to give jobs to Mexicans instead of hiring Americans. How is this confusing for you?\n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.52119 I get that the RNC wanted to change up the debate rules to avoid the hilarious and tragic internecine battles that we saw in 2012. But seriously, who came up with the idea of letting Fox News decide who gets to participate? Now we get to watch the likes of Donald Trump systematically lowering the standards of American politics, on national TV with a better spot on the stage than Jeb Bush. Oh, and they have way less time to answer questions, so we'll of course have plenty of fact-based arguments... right?\n-------------------------------------------------\nNone None Touche, that's probably a big factor.  So what do you think, once all the 2nd and 3rd tier candidates pull out and the GOP is left with Bush, Walker, Rubio &amp; Paul Trump will remain at ~25% and the rest will have a share of the 75%?  Because I can't imagine his numbers going down much, rather slowly increasing as candidates fall out.\n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.775254 It would be funny if Trump comes out with a reserved intelligently written script and is overwhelmingly noncontroversial and legitimizes himself by pointing out that the bought and payed for establishment candidates are attacking his 'reasonable platforms'. He just focuses on denying everything he has said up until this point as media spin and says nothing controversial the entire night. Of course, the next day he could just call them all losers and flaunt his victory like a small child.\n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.467321 But which polls? They are supposed to 'aggregate' the results from the five 'most recent national polls' or something like that. What counts as 'good methodology'? How are the polls aggregated when they have different sample sizes? What happens if another poll comes out on August 5 that shows someone else in the lead? \n\nThere is a *lot* of room for Fox to exercise its own discretion under this arrangement. Sensationalism and eyebrow-raising soundbites are the name of the game in 24-hour cable news. So yeah, Trump is all set to take center stage. \n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.528789 This sub loves eating out of Trump's ass, all he wants is publicity. \n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.128406 Conservatives I know like Trump because he doesn't mince words with dog whistle phrases like States Rights and instead says blunt things like Mexico only sends the US drug dealers, rapists and other criminals and maybe a few decent people. Then he doesn't take back his words when people are horrified. These conservatives appreciate the plain talk of what their leaders have been saying in coded messages for years and they really like when someone doesn't take back what they said or admit that have made a mistake. GOP leaders and conservative media have created these preferences and Trump fulfils them more than the others. Therefore, Trump leads among Republican voters. \n-------------------------------------------------\nneutral None Trump is actually pro-abortion.\n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.318056 http://www.paddypower.com/bet/politics/other-politics/us-politics?ev_oc_grp_ids=791149\n\nSanders is 14 to 1, Trump is at 20 to 1 -- though it was 50 to 1 for him like a month ago. \n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.866797 Agreed, and I'm not a liberal socialist commie either. A 25 year Veteran, concealed carry holder but NOT a NRA member, living in the suburbs who VOTED for Gary Johnson (the actual libertarian candidate) last presidential cycle.\n\nI laugh at the gross underbelly of the Republican party that Trump is exposing. The Koch type of wealth influence on this countries politics is horrific. It is time to go [two steps forward,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Bill_of_Rights) as we've been in the [one step backwards](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/02/income-inequality-in-america-chart-graph) phase for *way* too long. More people need to go to www.isidewith.org and vote.\n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.440004 I don't like Trump, but holding him accountable for hiring legal foreign workers? I think it's absurd to attack people for hiring foreign workers legally... He vowed to protect American jobs from being sent to China, not that he vowed to stop people from getting work visas in America. I don't understand the point of this article other than some lame attempt to attack someone who has done TONS of much more objectionable things.     \n    \nHold him accountable for things that actually matter/are wrong. There is literally nothing wrong with hiring legal foreign workers (Americans even work legally in other countries). I'm not a fan of Trump, but as far as I know, he just dislikes illegal immigrants and sending jobs to China - neither of which contradict hiring legal foreign workers. \n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.533287 Trump is for sure off the Carson VP list.\n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.30489 I think we can't count on the shit-tier candidates pulling out.  If we could, none of them would even have started this shit-show.\n\nTrump's numbers have a semi-hard cap due to his high negatives.  I mean, it's possible that he will gain as others drop out, and his \"second choice\" numbers have improved a little, but I think it's disingenuous to think that a lead among 17 translates to a lead among two or three, especially in such a hatefully-fractured party.  \n\nthink the candidate among the top two or three with the lowest hard-negatives probably has the best shot - especially if the GOP is mindful of the fact that there's a general election in addition to their circus.\n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.324032 And I would generally agree with you. There is a demonstrable schism between the standard rank-and-file Republicans and the new Tea Party group. Trump, Cruz, Palin, most of the other inflammatory Republicans we see, they're Tea Party. And they're fucking wacko, man. I mean, I disagree with Republicans on a lot of things, but they're at least nominally okay at running the country when left to their own devices. I mean that in that, things don't immediately burst into flame. But under a Tea Party president? My god, do we really want to imagine what President Cruz would do? Or President Trump, with his cabinet full of people like Sarah Palin? \n\nThe problem is that the GOP is going through a demonstrable schism, and they're winning. That's bad news for the GOP. The left is going through no such schism - which is ALSO bad for the GOP. \n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.666015 Trump better personally address this immediately. You lead by example.\n-------------------------------------------------\nneutral None No orangutan presidents for a while because of Trump.\n-------------------------------------------------\nNone None And they should be rapists.

He hires contractors to do everything for him. He is responsible for hiring those contractors, and his authority is probably dictated by those contracts (which I clearly haven't read). It's questionable if hiring legal foreign workers is even wrong. Americans work legally around the world as well, so unless Trump made a public statement that he is against legal foreign workers, I don't see how this article is even relevant.     \n    \nI don't like Trump, but there are plenty of fair/reasonable ways to attack someone. This is probably one of the most minor things to attack him for possible. Attacking him for hiring contractors that build his buildings using things made in China or for having his line of ties made in China is much more reasonable, but this is just stupid. \n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.862485 Then Hillary is a shoe-in. Worst Trump logic ever. \n-------------------------------------------------\nNone None &gt;Donald Trump is staking his run for U.S. president in part on a vow to protect American jobs.\n\nWhat we have here is a failure to communicate. \n\nHe said he'd protect 'American jobs', not 'American workers'.\n\nThe **jobs** are still in America.\n\n__EDIT: Giving credit where it's due, from Wikipedia.org:\n\nThe phrase \"What we've got here is failure to communicate\" is a quotation from the 1967 film Cool Hand Luke, spoken in the movie first by Strother Martin (as the Captain, a prison warden) and later, slightly differently, by Paul Newman (as Luke, a stubborn prisoner).\n-------------------------------------------------\nNone None Not only are people paying attention to him and giving him a shot, but he leads all other candidates among Republican voters. And a recent poll showed that 70% of likely Republican voters agreed with his comments about Mexican immigrants being rapists. If Republican voters make up about half the voting public, that means that 35% of likely American voters agrees with Trump on Mexicans being rapists. Think about that...right off the bat he's got 35%. Add to that the percentage who will vote for whoever the GOP candidate is and he suddenly becomes a viable contender for the White House. That is why it is so important to get reasonable people off their butts and into the voting booths. \n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.790014 PLEASE GET THE WORD OUT..

Even if it's ideologically in contrast to the exact thing he's supposedly positing against. \n-------------------------------------------------\nNone None Interesting analysis.  It's true that a lead amongst 17 does not translate to a lead among far fewer.  I'm very curious where he will top out at though.  I think it'll be around 35%.  If he's at ~21-23% per RCP &amp; huffpost aggregates now, if he doesn't do something to make himself fall (which at this point I can't imagine what that would look like), then it's not inconceivable to think he has another 10% potential or so with ~13 dropping out.  \n\nThe people that favor him now are likely not going to change their mind because they represent a disenfranchised type of Republican, hence an increase is conceivable.  But then this would mean that Bush, Walker, Paul &amp; Rubio (assuming they're the final 4) would share in the remaining 65%, which would indicate Trump still being close to the top (possibly even with Bush since he's a favored 2nd choice).\n\nAdditionally, if not enough shit-tier candidates pull out then Trump will remain at the top going into the primary which would mean either securing the nomination or preventing anyone from gaining the required # of delegates (and I'm not sure what happens then.  Going to look it up now).\n\nEdit:  Oh ok, an undemocratic process ensues... \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brokered_convention\n\n*Once the first ballot, or vote, has occurred, and no candidate has a majority of the delegates' votes, the convention is then considered brokered; thereafter, the nomination is decided through a process of alternating political horse-trading, and additional re-votes. In this circumstance, all regular delegates (who, previously, were pledged to the candidate who had won their respective state's primary or caucus election) are \"released,\" and are able to switch their allegiance to a different candidate before the next round of balloting. It is hoped that this 'freedom' will result in a re-vote resulting in a clear majority of delegates for one candidate.*\n\n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.500683 In the workplace it really is.

I never called him a hypocrite.  It's entirely possible to want to change American policies around employment and still be profit-driven enough to hire foreign workers over Americans.  \n\nIn fact, I haven't given my opinion on really anything about him politically.  I'm only making observations.  *You* have drawn conclusions that you dislike from my statements, and *you* are defending him from those same conclusions.  \n\n\nIf this isn't as big a deal as you say it is, why are you vehemently defending him?  In my opinion, it is a big deal, and that has nothing to do with him being a hypocrite.  It has to do with *yet another* campaign blunder he's made.  Hopefully if he's elected, he doesn't do the same thing in global politics as our chief ambassador.  \n-------------------------------------------------\nneutral None Can we please stop putting Donald trump on the front page every day? Stop feeding the troll!! \n-------------------------------------------------\nNone None &gt; Do you really, for one second believe that this man, while on the campaign trail, personally oversees the hiring and firing of each employee?\n\nNo one believes that Donald Trump can or does operate on that level.  However, as his company's business leader, he does set the policies which make such labor practices possible or not.  Therefore, that buck stops with him.   I find it hard to believe that Trump would not be aware of the employment practices at one of his signature properties, like Mar-a-Lago, since he frequently visits it.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.387866 \"Nunberg allegedly wrote racially charged and disparaging political posts dating back to 2007, including one calling civil rights leader Rev.

Can you cite a source for that one? In the past he has boasted about supporting Reagan and Romney in his life. He \"leans right\" on much more than debt and immigration. Quite funny you use the phrase LEANS right though. I applaud your persona you have here\n-------------------------------------------------\nNone None &gt;Do you feel like Trump could be playing a shell game? Like, he's being a crazy xenophobe to appeal to a base\n\nTo a degree that's exactly what I think he's doing. Just like how Obama said he supports traditional marriage on the campaign trail but later came out in support. Trump was saying gay marriage should be legal in the late 90s, but when he was thinking about running for the republican nomination in 2012 all the sudden he supports traditional marriage, then when SCOTUS legalized gay marriage he said \"well it's already been decided\" and he seemed to be smiling, I believe that he was actually very happy about the decision- He's good friends with George Takei and many other gay people especially in tv/film production industry. Trump was also saying he thinks that healthcare should be right for all Americans as an entitlement in the late 90s as well. He said Bill Clinton was his favorite president in the modern era. Trump is a liberal man.   \n\nI don't think his opinion on immigration is that far right. He specifically said illegal immigrants.. He said illegal immigrant criminals, rapists, murderers and drug-dealers that we have deported are being pushed back into the US by the Mexican government. He said the Mexican government doesn't want to put up with these criminals so they dump them on the US to let our stupid leaders deal with their problems. He said nothing about legal immigrants. We have already taken 25% of Mexico's population.. at what point is it enough? Why not take more European immigrants as they are more likely to have money?\n\n&gt;but if he were to make it into the White House we'd actually see more of that registered Democrat side?\n\nI think Trump truly believes in a liberal society, it's just that he's a business man who doesn't like to see money wasted and he may have a more conservative approach of getting there. I really think he does care about the country and would do what he believes is best for us as a nation. He's already got a ton of money, I think he wants to do this as part of his legacy to be remembered as good leader for the country.

As a teacher in a union, I take this issue pretty seriously. Now, I don't particularly take Donald Trump seriously but people need to realize that there is a real campaign to bust teachers unions.\n\nLook at the privatization movement in education. All the charter schools popping up all over the nation.  Those teachers are non-union.

The first reasons why that came to mind are that he is against marriage equality and believes climate change to be a hoax. He once accused a Scottish farmer of \"Destroying the great beauty of the world\" for installing wind turbines. He has a history of disrupting green energy efforts because he thinks they detracts from the aesthetics of the land.\n\nHe does support universal healthcare though. So that's something.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nneutral None It may sound weird but he could take some of the air out of the Trump balloon because Biden is known for speaking plainly and that seems to be a large part of Trump's popularity.

He goes through other companies that do their own hiring to ensure the jobs he needs gets done.\n\nTrump will be protecting American jobs, because he will lower the minimum wage. Hardly anyone is living off of minimum wage. Most people who work minimum wage jobs are kids or immigrants who are just starting off. Many people living off of food stamps in areas like Detroit or poor metropolitan areas, like poor parts of New York, New Orleans, etc cannot find jobs because the minimum wage is too high. Many of these people would rather work for less, than be dependent on something that only provides them with bare essentials. Even if they only worked for $8 an hour, that'd be a lot more than what living of off food stamps provides. If you care about people who live in rough areas, you'll support a lower minimum wage. If you care about small businesses that can't afford to hire more help, you'll support lower minimum wages.\n-------------------------------------------------\nneutral None Yeah but my original comment was replying to him talking about he thinks Trump would be better for the economy than Hillary Clinton lol.

So Trump looks overseas and finds someone with the necessary talent and experience AND willing to work for $30,000. \n\n\nIn my field, there are probably people working in China/India for 1/5th of the pay.

Her politics are so mushy you don't know where she stands on anything except for open borders. She has no integrity, all her votes have already been bought and paid for by big business. Can you name ONE republican who made half as much as Hillary just by speaking to banks? She wasn't giving them investment advice and at $300,000 a speech you can be sure the only thing these banksters wanted were political favors... 10/10 would sell out the whole country for a couple million in donations to her Clinton charity racket, just like she sold off a huge portion of the US's uranium production to the Russians. The banks who want these sell-out trade deals are Hillary's main financial backers. \n\n&gt;He has had five of his companies filed for bankruptcies and schemes the game rather than play it.\n\nEvery large investor has some deals that just don't work out. Many of the bankruptcies were just licensing deals where they only paid Trump to use his brand, but he didn't actually own the business.. as was the case with the NJ casinos and golf courses that went bankrupt that he didn't actually own. He's never filed for personal bankruptcy.\n\n&gt;He would be a terrible president\n\nEverything I know to be true about Hillary tells me she would be much worse.. maybe if she gets the nomination and loses the democrats will pick a better candidate next time.

The two sides are the workers and the wealthy.  Both sides want as much money as they can get.   Therefore the investment class and corporations want to pay workers less to maximize their revenue.  Along side with that, the wealthy want to charge people (generally the same workers) more for their goods, services, rent, etc.  The workers, on the other hand, want the exact opposite.\n\nThis is the fight that's been ever present, but one side is clearly winning.  The rich have the anlogous military might of the USA while the workers are positioned like El Salvador or somesuch place.  \n\nThe problem is as the rich obtain more wealth as a percent of the country's total worth, it gives them more power and the people less ability to compete.  It has exponential ramifications.  We have to reverse this trend where the already wealthy have a monopoly on pretty much everything, and I just don't see Trump's policies as being effective in this regard.   \n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.295737 I never said anything about Hillary, but her past as Secretary of State and a senator shows she would be a better choice than Trump.

Typically most workers of other cultures were not allowed to be seen and always in the background running the club. I worked as a valet and ran into many celebrities on a daily basis. I worked for this club during the famed \" Rosie O'Donnell dispute\" I have seen many personal rants and tantrums Donald Trump has had. Everything from throwing a toilet off a balcony to pudding of his near by neighborhood with a gigantic American flag. So many stories. Feel free to ask.

They range from naming a courthouse after Thurgood Marshall to naming a Post Office after Jonn A. O'Shea. Virtually none of the legislation Hillary passed as Senator had any impact or meaning at all.- Her track record is absolutely terrible. \n\n&gt;Trump has no plan at all and thinks he can use the military willy-nilly.\n\nHe's discussed a bunch of plans- universal healthcare plus he doesn't want to cut any of the safety net, says we'll pay for it with import tariffs and domestic job creation. Preventing further illegal immigration will make jobs go begging until wages go up to a level that Americans are willing to work for. He wants to charge Saudi Arabia and Europe for US military bases. He wants to cut back the Federal Department of Education, etc. He's better than Hillary and would be more respected by other countries than Hillary and a better negotiator on behalf of the US's interests. He argued against the Iraq war. Trump may be tough on the Iran deal, but he doesn't want to start a war with them and he says he would pursue better relations with Putin's Russia and avoid future war with them. \"Lindsey Graham just wants to bomb everybody.\"- Trump\n\n\n\n&gt; He is living in a fantasy land, and has never shown to be able to be the least bit civil to anyone \n\nHe has plenty of friends and people he's been civil with.

I would love to hire locals and Americans for every position. Not only for moral reasons but it makes my day easier when I can effectively communicate with my staff. We are working on programs to bring on more seasonal American workers but until I can get people to apply for house keeping and dishwashing jobs we will be forced to use other labor pools. \nTo be fair the people we bring on from other countries are here to see America and have a unique work situation where they have subsided housing and weekly trips. These jobs are only for a few months and wouldn't be an alternative to gainful employment for the people who live in town year round....\nBut seriously, fuck trump.

If it's Trump or Clinton, I'm voting Trump because if I'm going to get fucked, I'd at least like to know who's doing the fucking and how they're doing it.\n\nAlso, I think he's a superior administrator than Hillary Clinton.\n-------------------------------------------------\nNone None &gt; It's not just Wisconsin, just look at what Brownback did to Kansas.\n\nAnd for that reason, Brownback is the only person that stands a chance of defeating Walker.\n\nThe prize goes to the Governor who turned his state into the largest cesspool. Jindal isn't in the running because of where Louisiana started.

Stupid argument, but also kind of a silly move on Trump's part since he was talking a big game about bringing jobs back. He's not in the wrong, but this is not what people want to see from a candidate that espouses creating jobs for Americans. \n-------------------------------------------------\nneutral None Until trump is done leading the clown car that is the gop nomination list I do not think you'll be seeing any less of Mr Toup\u00e9e\n-------------------------------------------------\nNone None TRUMP=ASS CLOWN\n-------------------------------------------------\nneutral None Well, Trump is the stumper in this situation since he's funding his campaign with his own money.

They don't know anything. How are you going to preserve american jobs if you don't know why people hire foreigners in the first place.\n\nIt's not ethics, it's business. I don't care what drivel these guys spout about how much they love american workers, it won't crete one damn job.\n\nThey're losers. They're poor. They're going to lose the election. They guy who wrote this, and the guy who posted it. Both looooosers. Get the hell outta here.\n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.680326 Donald Trump and his corporate teams would be liable to legal action from his shareholders if they were being negligent in making profits.

See what I did there?!\n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.397206 You have a reasonable point. But I think your point misses the point. The expectation isn't that Donald Trump will directly oversee the day-to-day management of every facet of his businesses, and that he is somehow directly responsible for this. However, if you're going to campaign for the highest office in the country on the platform of protecting American's jobs, you had better make damn sure that every business you own, and every arm of those businesses (and if you can swing it, even the other businessed with which your own businesses partner with) have a policy of not importing workers from overseas/across the border to work for lower wages in order to increase profit margins for yourself. Otherwise, you're going to look like a fool and hypocrite. It doesn't really matter whether you signed the papers that hired the workers. What matters is that you are saying you hold value 'x', yet you have done nothing to disable those in your employ from working directly against value 'x'. It completely undermines your credibility.\n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.515157 It always makes me skeptical when news articles don't have direct quotes about this sort of stuff.\n\nNowhere in the article do they have a direct quote of Trump saying \"no black presidents for a while because of Obama.\"\n-------------------------------------------------\nneutral None I mean, if it's Clinton vs Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, or Donald Trump...\n\nWhat we really need is some kind of election reform, getting rid of first-past-the-post, so that we're not stuck in this crappy two-party thing where we're forced to pick the least smelly turd of the bunch.\n-------------------------------------------------\nneutral None They linked to the ABC transcript. They were questioning him about a tweet Trump made last year:\n\n&gt;KARL: So let me ask you about something you tweeted last year. You said of Barack Obama, \"Sadly, because President Obama has done such a poor job as president, you won't see another black president for generations.\"\n\n&gt;What did you mean by that?\n\n&gt;TRUMP: Well, I think he's been a very poor president. I think he has done a very poor job as president. We have $18 trillion right now in debt and going up rapidly.\n\n&gt;KARL: But what did you mean? What --\n\n&gt;TRUMP: Wait a minute.\n\n&gt;The world is -- we don't have victories anymore. China is killing us on trade. Mexico's killing us at the border and also killing us on trade. Mexico's doing unbelievably against us in trade.\n\n&gt;You look at what's going on with Japan. You look at what's going on with Vietnam. You look at Saudi Arabia, makes $1 billion a day and we defend them. We get nothing.\n\n&gt;KARL: I understand your critique. But why do you say that means we won't see another black president for generations?\n\n&gt;TRUMP: Because I think that he has set a very poor standard. I think that he has set a very low bar and I think it's a shame for the African American people.\n\n&gt;And by the way, he has done nothing for African Americans. You look at what's gone on with their income levels. You look at what's gone on with their youth. I thought that he would be a great cheerleader for this country. I thought he'd do a fabulous job for the African American citizens of this country.\n\n&gt;He has done nothing. They are worse now than just about ever and --\n\n&gt;KARL: But --\n\n&gt;TRUMP: -- they are -- excuse me. They have problems now in terms of unemployment numbers, look at their unemployment numbers. And you have -- here you have a black president who's done very poorly for the African Americans of this country.\n\n&gt;And I think that I will win the African American vote and I think I will win the Hispanic vote. And if you see the recent polls that came out, Jon, you'll see that because I'm leading in the Hispanic vote.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.845955 Trump's life is a satirical act about his own life.\n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.824744 That's kind of the catch with Trump. When it benefits him he will say that anything he is even remotely associated with is 'his' and is the 'best in the world'. In reality, he may not even be a majority stakeholder or have anything to do with top-down decision making.\n\nThe frustration is that he intentionally plays up how important he is in the success of everything he touches, but then distances himself from anything that reflects negatively.\n\nThe guy is a wordsmith and a master at framing. This makes it hard to ever catch him in a contradiction because he'll just reframe himself out of the corner, and low information supporters will cling to what he says.\n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.629197 You think Trump will be good with money?  The guy has declared bankruptcy like four times.\n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.678864 I still want to know why Trump wears that hat saying \"Make America Great Again.\" I mean, he's saying AMERICA is not great. America. Not too long ago, one of the Dixie chicks mumbled something negative about President Bush (just the man, not the country) and they were pretty much kicked to the curb. Why does Trump hate America?\n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.321585 To be fair (and I CAN NOT believe I'm defending trump) he's not the only politician and  businessman to do that.

At all. Which is why some idiots like him.  Which fucking blows because he's a piece of shit and anyone that likes him is a piece of shit too. \n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.659712 I don't like Trump, but that has nothing to do with anything. \n-------------------------------------------------\nneutral None Looks like he is using the old Donald Trump routine.  \n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.324093 Be honest, it is the people who support Sanders and Trump who are being punished, dissed, dismissed and denied.\n-------------------------------------------------\nneutral None No orange ones for a while either because of Trump\n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.226198 Bigger than Cruz, Trump, and Perry?

I don't think that Trumps election will be any worse than any of the other political contenders. \n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.61077 Like I said before if the Trump candidacy has one positive outcome he can expose people like Scott Walker for the brainless puppets they are.

Either to protect them, or to create them. \n\nTrump is getting support not because of what he is saying (which isn't all that good. Doesn't really sound lIke Ron Paul. Mostly it's just trite old boilerplate) but because the Repub demographic have figured out that Washington insiders and Establishment politicians can't be trusted. \n\nAnd they're not wrong about that. I say it is those libDems who think Hillary is better, more acceptable than Trump, who are the ones who are completely batshit crazy brainwashed kool-aid drinkers. \n\nOn this, the Repub base &amp; Tea Partiers are simply better than the hysterical hystrionic LibDem kook partisan wanker nutjobs who populate sites like Salon, Slate, Huffpo, etc.\n\nIf those assholes had any sense, understanding of politics, they'd STFU about Trump, pay him 0 attention, and concentrate on destroying the Clinton campaign and eradicating all Clintonite &amp; Obamaite influence and power from the Dem party. \n\n\n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.478781 I sure don't either (neither Kasich nor Trump), but I'd take Kasich over practically any other Republican who's currently running, including Jeb. \n-------------------------------------------------\nneutral None Since Trump touts a American first like slogan he should be hire only Americans and not hiring foreigners to replace American workers.

Orangutans are wise men of the forests, Trump is a naked molerat with Orangutan hair glued to himself.\n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.632054 Much as Trump is despicable this is what's called the 'lump of labour fallacy'. There simply isn't a finite supply of jobs so that each immigrant in work means one fewer American in work. It just doesn't work that way, note that population has tripled since the 1920s and yet we don't have a one third employment rate.\n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.825172 I believe Americans are better than that. It's unfortunate that Trump feels he has to pull out the racist dog whistle to keep his poll numbers up.\n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.27376 Im no fan of this jack ass or anything, but Donald Trump has made it clear that he does this kind of stuff because it's more expensive to stay in America.\n\nIt's like how Bernie Sanders will say that 15 dollars an hour should be a living wage while paying his interns 12 dollars an hour.\n\nLaws need to be put into place for these things to happen. \n  \n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.452235 Great for Trump, terrible for his business, employees, creditors, and pretty much everyone else.\n\nCan't wait to let him be president...\n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.339194 Can we please stop talking about  Donald \"Spread it out in small doses\" Trump? You guys know his existence is literally just to distract people from real issues. He's not important, the sooner we ignore him the sooner he'll go away.

I bet his asshole smell nicer than his month.\n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.349459 You realize the one who said they love immigration and that their wife is an immigrant is Jeb Bush right? He's also been insulted by Trump because of his Mexican-American wife, with Trump saying that because Bush has a legally immigrated wife, he can't have a proper stance on illegal immigration. How does that sound like he's trying to make it better and faster?\n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.270421 I don't know how misleading the headline is, but let me use a sports analogy.\n\nIt is pretty well accepted by baseball historians that if the Jackie Robinson experiment hadn't worked out, it would be a long time before another player could have been brought up from the negro leagues.  Jackie was selected because of his talent in the game, his demeanor, and his activities off the field.  He was the first and if more were to follow he needed to be highly successful in all facets.  \n\nGeraldine Ferraro was exactly right that Obama was selected partially because of his race.  He wasn't the first black man to run, of course.  He wasn't the most experienced black man.  He was the first black man who ran that had a chance at appealing to most of white America.  If he fell on his face, it would be a long time before another black man was elected president.  It's not something that most Americans would admit to, but there is an almost subconscious race element in American politics that spans both parties.\n\nNow, if you believe that Obama was a horrendous failure, it wouldn't be a stretch to say that it would be a long time before another black man was president.\n\nFerraro was demonized for speaking openly and honestly about race.  Most Americans don't want people who are willing to have a completely honest dialog about race.  I don't know if Trump is right or wrong, but I will say that the point has validity but most people are too dishonest about race to admit it.\n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.370401 I'm no trump fan, but to be fair, most resorts hire immigrant workers. It's just what they do. I've been to some ski areas in the states where at least half of the staff are foreigners. \n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.140608 People spend their entire lives devoted to studying one nuanced facet of the economy or researching one protein involved with the pathophysiology of a disease. I don't think it's too much to ask for our Presidential hopefuls to stand up on a stage and discuss their plans for our country, have those plans criticized and then see how they respond. I'm not a fan of Bernie, but I know Reddit is in a perpetual circle jerk over him, so I'll put it like this: does the better candidate not benefit from more debates? It allows lesser known people like Bernie to have a platform to show why they are the better candidate. If I'm in Hillary's camp, the less times I have to put her on stage against Bernie, the better. I can prepare her to be generic and deflect 3 or 4 times on stage, but candidates begin to get exposed the longer the debates go on, much like Romney in 2012 (and I supported the guy). Bernie has no releastic shot at getting the nomination, but he is a gifted public speaker, especially compared to Hillary's robotic, non-authentic demeanor and more debates would certainly help his bid. It also gives people the chance to flame out, like Trump. The longer the debates wear on, the more likely it is Trump will continue to say racist things and lose his temper and hopefully help him fizzle out. \n-------------------------------------------------\nNone None Are you sure? I read here:\n\nhttp://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/06/16/donald-trump-transcript-our-country-needs-a-truly-great-leader/\n\n\nIf you have a more complete one, i'm interested.\n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.838762 Donald Trump is a huge fucking hypocrite. Who could possibly have guessed?\n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.51043 You mean Donald Trump isn't honest about the things he preaches? Well, i am surprised.\n-------------------------------------------------\nNone None Perhaps you need to re-listen or re-read the transcript.  He did not qualify the problem with Mexico sending its people with the word \"illegal\" once.  You can assume what he meant all day, but when he says Mexico is \"sending its people\" that does not mean sending them illegally.  Lots of countries might encourage their people come to the US for education or whatever reason.  He should have qualified his statement, but he didn't because I think he doesn't make much distinction between the two in his head.  Just my opinion.\n\nhttp://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/06/16/donald-trump-transcript-our-country-needs-a-truly-great-leader/\n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.58807 The first reasonable top-level post I find, and predictably, all the liberals are plugging their ears and saying \"la la la I don't care about your rationality, all I know is I don't like Trump!\"\n-------------------------------------------------\nneutral None For someone who's set about to chastise the histrionic left, you're doing a mighty fine job of demonstrating how emotionally irrational you can be, considering you evidently can't seem to go more than a paragraph before going after your ideological opponents and resorting to bitter insults. It's really not helping to support your stated premise there, chief.\n\nFurther, while you're not wrong, none of them are inherently trustworty... if you honestly think that old Donald Trump is doing any better on that scale, I seriously have to question your state of mind. No, I am not trying to insult you here, I am genuinely concerned. History has shown us that the only thing that sets him apart from the slimy, duplicitous political class is that he's more open about about his seedy behavior. In fact, the man quite evidently revels in it, having spent the last decade turning himself into as much of a brand as his business and this from a man who's long been known to be better at exploiting the system and bullying his peers than actually running businesses.\n\nHow anyone can even begin to think this man knows anything about the country, cares about the lower classes, and would do anything other than protect his investments as president, I can't even fathom. The man obviously has an evident interest in growing his own businesses (in addition to his endless fascination with war, which we're not in any sense financially capable of handling at this point, let alone without damaging our relationship with our foreign allies) and how do you do that in the current system? Well, by creating more loopholes and exceptions to the rules that only businesses can take advantage of!\n\nPersonally, while I am no fan of Hillary Clinton, if we're going to elect a pro-business, war-monger into office this time, I would much rather it be someone that knows and gives the faintest fuck about the country and not an avowed and well-known asshole, regardless of which side they're on. And when you're going up against an asshole, you simply can't pay them no mind, their antics demand recognition.\n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.119979 Or they both said they love their immigrant wives?  They can't both have said that? All he said was he would understand if it was harder for Bush to take a stance on illegal immigration because his wife was Mexican.  At the end of the day, he has said in pretty much every single interview, ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION BAD, LEGAL IMMIGRATION GOOD! Then, expounded many times that legal immigration should probably be improved.\n\nYou really are assuming a lot here when he has been pretty explicit.  The funny thing is this is exactly why people like Trump, you don't have to guess at what he believes in.  I go to Bush, who knows... he hasn't made official statements yet.  No one knows what Hillary believes in for half the stuff out there.  Want to know what Trump believes in?  It's so simple, just ask him.  Who woulda thought that you could run for office without first having to create a canned response to everything.\n\nThis is why Trump is getting popular.\n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.578359 If trump becomes president, he won't do everything promised as most logical people would know. The fact that he's not a seasoned politician is what I like. He doesn't need money like the rest of the candidates. This is why both dems and republicans are scared of Trump. \n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.840404 Trump needs to write this shit down.\n-------------------------------------------------\nneutral None you need to stop with the \"Donald Trump\" rant...\n\nAre you objecting to illegals, or ANYONE who comes here?\n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.365075 hehe has nothing to do with the Donald.

EVERY single thing was 'Made in China'.  I was watching the news with him spouting off about making America Great by investing in America, on a Chinese tv, on a Chinese bed supping a coffee that was made by a Chinese coffee pot.\n\nBut we knew he was a hypocrite a long time ago, right?\n-------------------------------------------------\nneutral None Trumps buildings are pretty gaudy.

Trump is just the least polished of them. \n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.303221 False. You sir are just not paying attention.\n\nMost conglomerates have a Chairman of the board. Reporting to him/her is the CEO, who makes the executive decisions on behalf of the Chair. Reporting to this man are the remainder of the board members. Including the heads of any subsidiary companies, usually referred to as \"Presidents\", like a casino or entertainment subsidiary, as an example.\n\nThis head appoints the Vice of the subsidiary who runs the show and reports to the board through the president. S/he in turn hires a business manager to run the day to day operations of the company, while the VP does all the business dealings for the subsidiary. This business manager then hires departmental heads, who individually runs their own departments. Like personnel. The personnel manager then is responsible overall for setting the hiring practices for the subsidiary, in our example a casino.\n\nThis manger typically sets the hiring policy for the company and then hires several people to assist them. One hires cooks, one the waiters, one the bellhops and valets, etc.\n\nThis person, however, will typically be responsible for making large hires or multiple people, not his/her subordinates.\n\nNot his boss, the Business Manager.\nNot his boss, the Vice President.\nNot his boss, the President.\nNot his boss, the CEO.\n\nAnd certainly not the Chairman of the Board of Directors of The Trump corporation.\n\n\nSo it isn't a FUCKING excuse.\n\nIts the fucking way a business runs. Maybe learn a bit about business before you spout off.\n\nIf Trump puts his money where his mouth is and institutes a policy changing The Trump Corporation's hiring practices, then no harm, no foul. Good odds this reject won't though, which is just typical of loud mouths.\n\nBut to flay the guy for things his subordinates do on his behalf? Seriously. That's like saying every time a soldier commits a war crime the president should also be charged with the same war crime, instead of saying that the president should change the training and policies in place to prevent that shit from happening. Both are responsible, much like Trump and his underling, but one fucked up and the other can fix it.\n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.835563 i love how you crackheads keep posting about trump like he's actually a viable candidate...\n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.579466 He's made a shit ton of money by using free market policies.  Now that it's going against his agenda he's spouting off at the mouth so that people will listen and pay attention.  And of course they are.\n\nIt drives me nuts that he's being considered seriously by anyone.  I do understand the fact that people see immigration as a necessary reform, and he brings that to the limelight in running.  But he also called Mexican immigrants rapists.\n\nI don't have the highest of opinions of either party; but from Palin to Trump the Republicans continue to show they don't know how to relate to your average American voter and their values.\n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.486545 Keep passing the buck off to someone else.  I guess that would be a pitiful way to snake out of taking any responsibility, but Trump is up on a podium telling how he'd improve the country by doing x when he/his company/his workers/his CEO/his COO/whatever lame excuse you want to come up with does -x. \n\nI've never heard of someone so full of hot air being defended for something so blatantly hypocritical. \n-------------------------------------------------\nneutral None Let me ask you something, do you think trump was the one who chose to get these legal immigrants for these jobs?\n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.583948 According to Trump, the police are why he has such a great relationship with the blacks. /s\n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.433627 I have been following Sanders for a few years now. I have been hoping he or Warren would run for a long time. Sanders gets nowhere near the coverage as Trump, and whe he does it's a footnote or brush off. Sanders wants to cut into the media's bottom line. They don't want his message spread. Trump is a buffoon that gets ratings. \n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.616371 Not sure if this has bee posted yet.

I am working with people from the Philippines, Bulgaria, South Africa, Poland, and many other places, and they are all so happy that they are here and work so hard to be able to go home with experience and money. I don't like Trump at all, but this is a relatively common thing in nicer hotels and resorts in their high seasons. Most Americans want full time long term employment, whereas there are Visas that grant anywhere from 5 months to 3 years of work (depending on the visa issued) and then they have to go home. They still have to file taxes, work full time hours, get paid the same as normal employees, but can afford to work the high seasons and not expect to stay full time. While I don't like or agree with Trump, read the article and you'll see that this is not what the headline makes it out to be.\n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.88841 That isn't hypocritical at all. If your interpretation of his position is correct, he may advocate for changing laws, while operating his business in a manner that takes advantage of the laws he wants to change. There is nothing hypocritical about that. \n\nIt would be like if you were playing a game of monopoly, with a house rule that you could take a hundred dollars every turn. You could observe that the rule should be changed to make a more interesting game, while still collecting your hundred dollars. \n\nDonald Trump is legitimately a very stupid person who would be a terrible President.  However, criticism of him should be based in reason and evidence, and not bizarrely contorted news stories with flimsy accusations of hypocrisy. Hypocrisy like this is just a lazy excuse on the part of morons to justify their existing opinions. \n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.656855 Trump isn't afraid of suing people for ridiculous reasons.

That ability he has in spades.\n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.611477 Most people I've heard bad talking Hillary in favor of Trump never would've voted for Hillary anyway regardless of whatever foppish puppet the right puts up this time.\n\nRaucous applause from the Republican base is a far, *far* cry from being *sane* enough to win over independents, moderates, and a few centrist Democrats to actually get more than 50% of the vote.\n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.807391 Jesus Christ.  He makes Trump and even Walker sound erudite.\n-------------------------------------------------\nNone None I'm voting for Bernie but if it comes down to Hillary &amp; Trump, I'd take a chance on him.  He's made it pretty clear (if you bother listening to various interviews since he lacks political correctness &amp; tosses out ridiculous one liners) that business is business which is all about the bottom line.  If you make it more viable for business owners to do the right thing they will.  At least he's talking about these issues unlike his opponents who will make promises without addressing the causes because the people finding their campaigns are the ones who benefit from the status quo.  \n-------------------------------------------------\nneutral None Plot twist: Bush and Walker (and whoever rounds out the Fox 10) get stuck in a mud-wrestling match with Trump, while the B-list, currently relegated to the Kiddie Table, gets to look mature and statesmanlike, to come from behind.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.739641 If you want to pick the worst Republican, choose Jeb Bush, he's an embarrassment. Ted Cruz is smart and brave, Trump has some great ideas, but, honestly, I think the person that deserves to be our next president, above all else, is Dr. Ben Carson. He's someone that any party would be proud to call their president. He is running as a Republican, but he has seen all perspectives of this country. He is an incredibly smart man, a fair person above all else, and incredibly accomplished surgeon. If there is anyone that has a place to help manage our country's healthcare policies, immigration policies, and regulations, it is Dr. Ben Carson. Very fair to all groups of people.\n-------------------------------------------------\nneutral None My thought was \"when's Trump getting fired then?\"\n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.555113 Funny.

However, they were wary of the huge field and the sideshow losers who took up oxygen. By handing it to Fox (and Fox using Poll numbers), they achieved two things: They would be able to wash their hands of the business; and the sideshows could be limited in the name of space.\n\nOf course, the problem is Trump, and candidates like Trump. There is no way to deny Trump without simply telling him personally to fuck off; no hocus pocus with the rules that will allow them to exclude Trump and include important candidates like Bush, Rubio, Walker, etc. But telling him to bugger off would only fuel his candidacy; at least by letting him participate, they give him the chance to make a fatal error or be embarrassed.\n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.51918 Trump has a good talking point to immunize himself from these claims -- as a businessman, he \"played the game\" to maximize his profits. As a President, he'll use his inside knowledge to reform the system. It's a classic heel to hero point.\n\nHe used this device very effectively against Anderson Cooper in a recent interview. Cooper called him hypocritical for lobbying government officials so heavily in the past. Trump retorted that any good businessman would do that in the current system, and that only Trump is savvy and rich enough to immunize himself from lobbying efforts.\n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.682406  I would love to watch Christie and Trump \"debate\". I doubt either could obey the debate rules laid out.\n-------------------------------------------------\nneutral None He said this in a tweet almost a year old, not in the interview with ABC.

Once the smaller guys get out of the way the people currently voting for them in the polls will almost entirely either switch to Bush or Walker.

Trump thinks laws need to change, there is nothing hypocritical about continuing to do business with the existing law. For another example, it would be like if you thought a road shouldn't have a toll on it. Are you a hypocrite for still paying the toll, or using the road?\n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.59974 It seems to me that Donald Trump is only running for president to become more famous.\n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.775799 I am baffled by anyone who isn't a multimillionaire that thinks Donald Trump represents them in any way.  And yet they do exist. \n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.359171 That's not the same at all, the toll is a requirement under the law, where as Trump is choosing to engage in something he claims to be unfair/wrong. You can argue all day and not, but someone doing something that they think is wrong, is hypocritical, there is nothing to be confused about. Here is the merriam-webster definition of hypocrisy \"the behavior of people who do things that they tell other people not to do : behavior that does not agree with what someone claims to believe or feel.\" If he believes as he first stated, he is a hypocrite, plain and simple. \n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.435378 Well, let's analyze it. It says \"Trump is staking his run on a vow to **protect American jobs**\", but instead of hiring Americans to work in Florida, which is in America, he has applied to hire foreign workers.\n\nSo it looks like it's about Trump being hypocritical, and hiring **foreign** workers after he vowed to protect **American** jobs. In other words, if he were a man of his word, he would be trying to hire **American** workers for those jobs, thus protecting their jobs which are in America and held by Americans.\n-------------------------------------------------\nneutral None ok Trump time to put your money where your mouth is and prove it by volunteering on tv to show it's not so bad.  And no chickening out like that spineless coward Sean Hannity\n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.440406 lol, people have been saying that Trump is God's gift to comedians, but I think it's the opposite...the shit he says is so funny it threatens to run comedians out of business.\n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.574684 Trump is a fascist, it's not that complicated. He stands for unabashed power instead of hiding behind philosophical ideals the way the Koch brothers or the religious right do.\n-------------------------------------------------\nneutral None I don't get your point. Are you saying that you won't vote for Bernie because he can't win nationally? He has consistently considerably outpolled every Republican candidate, and the Republican primary this season is probably one of the biggest shitshows they've ever had. Every single candidate is a fucking joke, which is evidenced by the fact that right now, DONALD TRUMP is the frontrunner. That man has negative ratings so high as to guarantee he can't be elected nationally, and he's threatening to run as a Third Party candidate and take away crucial crazy votes away from the establishment candidate. And don't try and tell me Jeb Bush or Scott Walker can win. Bush's last name alone is enough to turn a lot of people off, and the union problem is one that will become much more apparent to Walker in a general election. Maybe Rubio will pull some kind of October surprise, but right now he is totally sidelined. \n\nAnd none of that is even taking into account the fact that the Republican party has as a whole committed demographic political suicide through its anti-immigrant and anti-minority action and rhetoric. They only have control of Congress through blatant manipulation at many levels. \n\nThis election is about Bernie Sanders versus Hillary Clinton. To me, the choice is frustratingly clear. \n-------------------------------------------------\nneutral None I'm not sure, I guess canada.

In fact his largest support base comes from lesser educated Americans, who understand politics less than he does, which is saying a lot. \n\nI really don't think he has the mental capacity to wrap his head around constitutional constructs and foreign diplomacy. And this isn't just a personal attack, it's an observation based on his many foot in mouth public comments. \n\nBut he's no alone in the field of Republican candidates that clearly don't understand national and international politics, like Christie, who has said he would end legal marijuana, and instantly gave up electoral votes for at least 4 states, and ignores that fact that polls show that's not what the majority of Americans want, even on the Republican side of the fence. \n\nUnfortunately the only candidate in the Republican ranks capable of garnering Republican votes without alienating or infuriating even his own support base appears to be Jeb, which takes us back to Idiocracy, only Idiocracy with diplomatic tendencies. \n-------------------------------------------------\nnegative -0.740339 This is the thing people miss on Trump. I'm not crazy about him but when you listen to him talk (in full interviews, not just snips) he is a good orator and is blunt. There isn't this political doublespeak or soft answers. He knows what he wants to do and he proclaim it with conviction. His leading margin is because he is not an \"establishment\" politician.

The only summation I can put together is DAE REPUBRICRANT DEBATES ARE GONNA BE BAD CAUSE ONE MINUTE CORRUPTION?!!  for one thing the one minute rule is important because the republicans have been notoriously bad on timing their answers.  a one minute rule is more like a five minute rule for these guys.  but more importantly its the first debate in a really exciting nomination process and all the author can say is REPUBLICANS BAD FOX NEWS CORRUPTION REAGAN ONE MINUTE IMPORTANT ISSUES DONALD TRUMP.

Would it make you a hypocrite to say that the road should have no toll, and to still use it?\n\nRegarding the definition, Trump is saying what the law should be, not what should be done with the current definition. Thus, Trump could be hypocritical only if he had power to affect the law and did not while stating the law should be changed, or if he started to say that it was immoral to hire legal immigrants under the current law, whole continuing to hire them. \n\nSince Trump isn't doing either of those, he isn't being a hypocrite (about this).\n-------------------------------------------------\npositive 0.0454099 would you say trump has experience with bankruptcy?  and if so, would you say he has experience emerging successfully from bankruptcy?  would you say the US would not benefit from this skill set?
