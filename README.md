### W251 Final Project

### Team Members

#### Overview
This project will explore processing large volumes of Yelp review data to formulate recommendations based on certain criteria and evaluate the sentiment of businesses.  

So for instance, if Joe's Pizza shop wants to understand the sentiments around their business, this program would be able to data mine Yelp, Twitter, Instagram, and SnapChat(TBD) social mentions and provide an integrated sentiment analysis of the business. 

Here's what we may get (depending on the avaiability):
Twitter: Text and Hashtags
Instagram: Hashtags (if feasible)
Yelp: Review Text
Snapchat: Not sure - TBD

We will start off with Yelp and further explore Twitter/Instgram/Snapchat for streaming analysis. 
If we find that there is lack of streaming data, we may explore other options like Political Sentiment analysis during live debates, or sports team sentiment analysis during live sports events.
